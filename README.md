# Using LaTeX for Resumes

A new and improved introductory LaTeX resume template based on u/Quil180's template, only with more documents on what is happening and modularized for easy organization and cleaner code.

## Todo
- Make documentation standardized (ex. Didier Verna, Toward LaTeX coding standards)
- Design an actual step-by-step presentation to hold workshop
